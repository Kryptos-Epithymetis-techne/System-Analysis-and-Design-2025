## DriverPass Project

The following repository contains system analysis and design documents for the DriverPass project, completed as part of my coursework in system analysis and design for the Computer Science degree program of Southern NewHampshire University.

### Project Summary

The DriverPass project was completed for a client who wanted to create an online platform to help students prepare for their driving tests. The client, DriverPass (represented by the owner Liam), identified a gap in driver training—many students fail their driving tests due to inadequate preparation. They wanted a system that would provide online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training reservations, with different package options for customers. The system needed to support students, instructors, administrators, and IT staff, with features including user account management, appointment scheduling, progress tracking, and secure payment processing.

### What I Did Particularly Well

I excelled at translating the client's verbal requirements from the interview transcript into clear, organized technical documentation. My UML diagrams effectively captured the system's complexity while remaining understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I was particularly proud of how I identified and documented non-functional requirements like security and scalability that weren't explicitly stated but were critical to the system's success.

### Areas for Revision

If I could revise one aspect of my work, I would enhance the use case descriptions in the business requirements document. While they captured the basic functionality, I would add more detail about alternative flows and exception handling. For example, in the "Book Driving Lesson" use case, I could have better detailed what happens when an instructor cancels, when weather causes issues, or when payment processing fails. These edge cases are crucial for developers during implementation.

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted user needs by carefully analyzing the client interview transcript and identifying both explicit requests and implicit requirements. I created user personas for students, instructors, and administrators to understand their different perspectives and goals. I then translated these needs into functional requirements and system features—for example, recognizing that students need flexibility led to designing a mobile-responsive interface and rescheduling functionality. 

Considering user needs is essential because a technically perfect system that doesn't meet user expectations will fail. Users determine whether a system is successful through adoption and satisfaction. By prioritizing their needs—ease of use, accessibility, reliability—we create systems that solve real problems and provide genuine value.

### Software Design Approach

My approach to software design begins with thorough requirements gathering and stakeholder analysis. I use techniques like:

- **Interview analysis and note-taking** to capture client needs
- **Use case modeling** to understand user interactions
- **UML diagrams** (activity, sequence, class) to visualize system behavior and structure
- **Iterative refinement** by reviewing and revising designs based on feedback

In future projects, I would incorporate:
- **Prototyping and wireframing** to validate designs earlier with stakeholders
- **Design patterns** to solve common problems with proven solutions
- **User story mapping** to ensure all user journeys are covered
- **Regular stakeholder check-ins** throughout the design process rather than waiting until completion

These strategies ensure that designs are user-centered, technically sound, and aligned with business objectives.
